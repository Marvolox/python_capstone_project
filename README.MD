Day 1: Setting Up the Foundation

Task 1: Install Libraries (1 hour)
Install python-chess library for chess logic.
Explore libraries for timer functionality (e.g., threading).
Task 2: Chess Board Representation (2 hours)
Design a function to represent the chessboard in the terminal using ASCII characters.
Consider using different colors or symbols for pieces and squares.
Task 3: Player Input and Move Validation (3 hours)
Implement logic to handle player input for moves in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).
Use python-chess library to validate user-entered moves against the current board state.
Display error messages for invalid moves.

Day 2: Game Loop and Turn Management (2 hours)

Task 1: Game Loop (1 hour)
Develop a loop that continues until the game ends (checkmate, stalemate, or resignation).
Alternate turns between players within the loop.
Task 2: Turn Management (1 hour)
Display the current board state after each move.
Implement logic to switch between white and black player turns.
Show a timer for the current player's turn.

Day 3: Timer Implementation (3 hours)

Task 1: Choose Timer Library (1 hour)
Research and choose a suitable library for implementing a chess clock timer (e.g., threading).
Task 2: Timer Functionality (2 hours)
Implement a timer that starts on each player's turn and counts down to zero.
Update the timer display in the terminal on a regular basis.
Handle situations where the timer runs out (e.g., forfeit the player's turn).

Day 4: Finishing Touches and Testing (2 hours)

Task 1: Game End Conditions (1 hour)
Implement logic to detect checkmate, stalemate, and resignation conditions.
Display appropriate messages for each game end scenario.
Task 2: User Interface Enhancements (1 hour)
Add basic user interface features like asking for desired time limit before the game starts.
Consider including basic sound effects for piece movements (optional).
Task 3: Testing (throughout the project)
Test the game functionality thoroughly: valid/invalid moves, timer behavior, game end conditions.
Fix any bugs encountered during testing
