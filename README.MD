### Setting Up the Foundation

**Task 1: Install Libraries**
- Install `python-chess` library for chess logic.
- Explore libraries for timer functionality.

**Task 2: Chess Board Representation**
- Design a function to represent the chessboard in the terminal using ASCII characters.

**Task 3: Player Input and Move Validation**
- Implement logic to handle player input for moves in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).
- Use `python-chess` library to validate user-entered moves against the current board state.
- Display error messages for invalid moves.

### Game Loop and Turn Management

**Task 1: Game Loop**
- Develop a loop that continues until the game ends (checkmate, stalemate, or resignation).
- Alternate turns between players within the loop.

**Task 2: Turn Management**
- Display the current board state after each move.
- Implement logic to switch between white and black player turns.
- Show a timer for the current player's turn.

### Timer Implementation

**Task 1: Choose Timer Library**
- Research and choose a suitable library for implementing a chess clock timer (e.g., `threading`).

**Task 2: Timer Functionality**
- Implement a timer that starts on each player's turn and counts down to zero.
- Update the timer display in the terminal on a regular basis.
- Handle situations where the timer runs out (e.g., forfeit the player's turn).

### Finishing Touches and Testing

**Task 1: Game End Conditions**
- Implement logic to detect checkmate, stalemate, and resignation conditions.
- Display appropriate messages for each game end scenario.

**Task 2: User Interface Enhancements**
- Add basic user interface features like asking for the desired time limit before the game starts.
- Consider including basic sound effects for piece movements (optional).

**Task 3: Testing (throughout the project)**
- Test the game functionality thoroughly: valid/invalid moves, timer behavior, game end conditions.
- Fix any bugs encountered during testing.
